# Notes
**This is a simple application for notes keeping just like Notepad or Keeps from Google.**
***
# Features
For the start, I am keeping it simple. The following are the actions one could take when trying this app out:
* Create a new note
* Save a newly created note
* Edit an existing note
* Delete an existing note

*Bear in mind that one can not delete or edit a note that does not exist.*
# License
Since it is a simple app I decided to make available for anyone
